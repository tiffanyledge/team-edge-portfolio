    <h5>Who am I?</h5>
    <h5>My name is Tiffany. I am currently in high school. I joined a program called Code Next in hopes of being able to obtain new skills. That skill ended up being coding. Even though I don't aspire to become a engineer or coder, that doesn't mean that I can't learn about coding. These projects I have created here are the projects that I have been working on this summer. I hope to be able to use the skills that I have learned and apply them to life. </h5>
